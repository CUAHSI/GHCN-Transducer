# SCAN Transducer
Transducer to enable integrate the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) data into the CUAHSI catalog

The transducer contains two parts:
- SCANharvester.exe: this executable program updates metadata about available sites, variables and time series
- SCANservice: this ASP.NET website publishes the data in WaterML format

## Original data source
- USDA NRCS Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN): www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/scan/
- the data is retrieved from Air-Water Database (AWDB) Web Service: https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/web_service/awdb_web_service_landing.htm 

## SCAN Variable Names 
- This table documents the mapping of original SCAN Element names to [CUAHSI Controlled Vocabulary](http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=VariableNameCV) variable names:

## SCAN Time Support 
- For each available combination of SCAN element and duration, the WaterOneFlow service uses a separate variable code with duration attached to the element code. For example Daily average soil temperature is coded as *STV_D*, Hourly soil temperature as *STO_H*. The SCAN time support is also encoded by the *TimeSupport* element of the WaterML *Variable* object:

| SCAN duration | CUAHSI variable code part | CUAHSI time unit | CUAHSI time support value |
| ------------- | --------------------------| -----------------| --------------------------|
| HOURLY        | H                         | hour             | 1                         |
| DAILY         | D                         | day              | 1                         |
| SEMIMONTHLY   | sm                        | month            | 0.5                       |
| MONTHLY       | m                         | month            | 1                         |
| SEASONAL      | season                    | month            | 3                         |
| ANNUAL        | a                         | year             | 1                         |
| WATER_YEAR    | wy                        | year             | 1                         |
| CALENDAR_YEAR | y                         | year             | 1                         |

## Excluding time-aggregated SCAN Variables
- A special setting in the **appsettings.config** file of **SCANWebService** allows excluding variables with selected duration
from the WaterML web service response. By default, all durations are included.

## SCAN Heights and Depths 
- SCAN observations are recorded at different heights above ground or depths below ground surface. The height or depth value is always in inches. Negative value indicates a subsurface sensor (in the soil profile). Positive values are used for wind sensors at different heights above ground. The WaterOneFlow service represents the heights and depths using the VariableCode, Method and Offset. For example the CUAHSI variable code **SMS_H_D2** means "Volumetric water content measured hourly at 2 inches depth" or the CUAHSI variable code **WSPDV_D_H40** means "Average wind speed (daily) at 40 inches height".

## Resulting CUAHSI variable code
- The resulting CUAHSI variable code consists of two or three parts separated by the **underscore** character. 
- The first part is the SCAN element code (for example SMS, TMAX, WSPDX ...)
- The second part is the time support abbreviation (H, D, sm, m, season, a, wy, y) - see table above
- The third part is only included if the variable can be measured at multiple heights or depths (for example D40, D2, H60, H120 ...) The "D" means depth below ground surface and the "H" means height above ground surface.
- For example the CUAHSI variable code **SMS_D_D40** means "Volumetric water content (daily) at depth of 40 inches
- another example: The CUAHSI variable code **TMAX_m** means "Maximum air temperature (monthly) with no specified height or depth.
- For each time series with a specified height or depth, a specific **method** is assigned in the WaterML *GetSiteInfo* response.
- For each data value with a specified height or depth, a specific **OffsetValue** is assigned in the WaterML *GetValues* response.


## Setup Instructions for SCAN Harvester
1. Install an empty ODM 1.1.1 database on your Microsoft SQL Server. 
- To install an empty ODM 1.1.1 database, create a new database on the database server and execute the script https://github.com/CUAHSI/GHCN-Transducer/blob/master/odm/odm_111.sql
- Alternatively the empty ODM database can be created with the "Attach Database" command using the file: https://github.com/CUAHSI/GHCN-Transducer/blob/master/odm/OD.mdf
2. Open the solution SCANharvester.sln in Visual Studio
3. Edit the file app.config: fill in the correct database server, database name, database user and database password for the ODM database.
4. Build the solution and run the command-line program SCANharvester.EXE
5. While executing the SCANharvester.EXE connects to the AWDB web service and populates the Variables, Sources, Qualifiers, Sites and SeriesCatalog tables in the ODM database. Progress report of the update including errors and exceptions is saved in a log file in the same directory as the EXE.

## Setup Instructions for SCAN Web Service
1. Setup and run SCANharvester as described above
2. Open the solution SCANWebService.sln in Visual Studio
3. Inside the genericODws project, create a file ConnectionStrings.config and fill in the correct database server, database name, database user and database password for the ODM database. You can use the included file ConnectionStrings_example.config as an example.
4. If required, edit the file appsettings.config and uncomment or edit the setting <add key="exclude_durations" value="WATER_YEAR, CALENDAR_YEAR, YEARLY, SEASONAL, MONTHLY, SEMIMONTHLY"/> to exclude any time-aggregated variables from the WaterML response.
5. Build the solution
6. Copy the whole content of the "SCANWebService" folder to your a folder on IIS Web server where you want to publish the web service
